Data Structure and Algorithms

Algorithm- An algorithm is a step by step unambigious instructions to solve a given problem.
In the traditional study of algorithms, there are two main criteria for judging the merits of algorithms- 1.Correctness( does the algorithm give solution to the problem in finite number of steps) , 
2.Efficiency(how much resources (in terms of memory and time) it requires to run  an algorithm).

Why analysis of algorithm?
Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of space and time consumed.
